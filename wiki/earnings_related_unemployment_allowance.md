# Earnings related Unemployment Allowance

## Introduction

Earnings-related unemployment benefit is a benefit you can claim while unemployed.
The amount of earnings-related allowance is based on the salary you receive before
unemployment. Earnings-related unemployment benefit is only paid to members of unemployment
funds. To become a member of an unemployment fund, you have to apply for membership.
You can join a fund when you are working or self-employed.

The work does not have to be permanent, even short stints of work are enough to join.
If you move to Finland from another EU country, you can join an unemployment fund
while unemployed for a limited time. In this case your work history from another EU
country can normally accumulate your right to unemployment security in Finland.

Members of unemployment funds pay a fee that finances part of the benefits and
fund’s administrative costs. The amount of membership fee depends on your salary
and the fund you are a member of.

The average cost of membership for a person earning EUR 3000 per month is EUR 82 per year.
If you are not a member of an unemployment fund or have not been working or been
a member for long enough, you can claim unemployment benefit from Kela. The
unemployment benefit that Kela pays is not counted on the basis of your pay but is
the same amount for everyone.

## Which fund should I join?
In Finland there are ≈15 unemployment funds for employees and one unemployment
fund for the self-employed. Unemployment funds have about 2 million members.

field is a requirement for joining. Some require a specific training. In addition to this,
there are non-specific funds which anyone can join.

## When can I claim earnings-related allowance?

You can claim earnings-related allowance from an unemployment fund if:

- You are unemployed, temporarily laid-off, only partially employed through a part-time job or gig jobs or ceased your business activity
- You are seeking full-time employment and have registered as an unemployed job-seeker with the Employment and Economic Development Office (TE Office)
- You are a member of an unemployment fund
- You have been working for 26 weeks (approx. 6 months) while being a member of an unemployment fundor you have been working as an entrepreneur for 15
months while being a member of an unemployment fund for entrepreneurs.

If you are not a member of an unemployment fund or have not been working for long enough, you can apply for unemployment benefit from Kela.

If you live in another EU country while working in Finland, you can only claim unemployment benefits from Finland if you are partially unemployed (for example due to
layoffs or part-time work). If you are fully unemployed and you live in, for example,
Norway, Sweden or Estonia, you can claim unemployment benefits from the country
you live in. To get unemployment benefits, you must register as a job-seeker in the
country that pays your unemployment benefits.

## I just became unemployed, what should I do?

1. As soon as you become unemployed, register as a job-seeker via
the TE Office’s online service. Registration is valid immediately, but
cannot be applied retrospectively to, for example, the previous day.
Earnings-related allowance can be paid only for the period in which
the registration is valid. 
2. After two weeks, complete the daily allowance application in
your own unemployment fund’s online service.
After the initial application, continue to claim daily allowance in
four-weekly/monthly cycles.
The easiest way to start your job search and send an application to the
unemployment fund is to use the TE Offices and fund’s online service.
