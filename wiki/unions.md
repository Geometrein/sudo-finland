# Trade Unions

## Introduction
Knowing the rules of working life is important, but you don't have to navigate them alone, trade unions can offer help and support.
Trade unions protect established benefits like annual leave and overtime pay. They offer a community of professionals expertise, and legal services.

Trade union membership is **voluntary** but it is also every employee’s right.
You can already join the trade union during your studies, and student membership is often free of charge.
You can also change to a different trade union if you change to a different sector or your work tasks change.

By joining, you can influence collective labor agreements, which positively impact wages and working conditions.
Unions support members throughout their careers, including during job hunting, unemployment, layoffs, family leaves, or retraining.
They assist with contract reviews and salary negotiations. Expert help is just a chat, phone call, or email away.
When problems arise, members can seek help from union services. Trade unions also provide legal aid when necessary.

## Union vs Unemployment Fund
The operations of unemployment funds and trade unionions are governed by different laws.
By law the unemployment fund is responsible for arranging earnings-related unemployment allowance for its members.
The funds cannot organize other activities or benefits.
Membership is useful if you become unemployed or are laid off.

Trade unions are there to support you at all stages of your career.
Their activities are governed by law (Yhdistyslaki) which allows them to organize their activities quite freely.
However, the union does not pay earnings-related unemployment allowances, as this is the task of the unemployment funds.
The unions help their members in various working life situations, for example through legal services and career counselling, trainings and events.
They also participate in the preparation of laws and regulations related to the working life.

## Which Union should I join?
The choice of the union is individual. Different unions offer different benefits (legal help, salary counseling, events) it's up to you to choose the one that fits your needs.
Here is an incomplete list of unions targeting highly educated, engineers and IT.
