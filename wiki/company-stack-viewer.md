If you would like to add your own company info simply add the data to [this](../data/data.yaml)  `.yml` file in the root repo.

The web interface uses [sheilds.io](https://shields.io/badges) badges to fetch the tech icons so make sure to write the name of the technology correctly. The safest way is to copy it from an already existing record in the same `.yml` file.&#x20;
